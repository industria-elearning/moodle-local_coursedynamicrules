    ![Add conditions](__docs/images/local_cdr_add-conditions.png)

2. A view similar to the following will appear with the list of available conditions from which we can select the one we want to add, the information about each condition can be found in the following section [Available conditions](#available-conditions).
   
    ![Conditions list](__docs/images/local_cdr_conditions-list.png)

## Available conditions

### Activity completed

#### Description

This condition allows you to easily identify students who have completed a specific activity in the course. It can be configured to send automatic reminders to those who have completed the activity, helping you maintain their commitment and reduce inactivity.

#### Condition configuration

1. **Search course activity modules**: From this search field we can select the activity module that we want to verify that it has been completed.
   
   ![Activity completion search](__docs/images/local_cdr_activity-completion-search.png)

### Course inactivity at time intervals

#### Description

This condition makes it easy to identify students who have not accessed the course for specific periods of time from a base date, such as their enrolment date. You can configure it to send automatic reminders to those who have gone 7, 15, 22 days (or any desired interval) without entering the course, helping you maintain engagement and reduce inactivity.

Whether by evaluating custom intervals or by recurring monitoring at a fixed cadence, this condition helps keep students engaged and active in the course.

This condition runs recurrently every day at `00:00`, `06:00`, `12:00`, and `18:00` via the scheduled task `local_coursedynamicrules\task\course_inactivity_task`.

**IMPORTANT!** Do not modify this scheduled task's execution times, as it may cause inconsistencies when evaluating the condition.

#### Condition configuration

1. **Custom intervals**:
    Allows you to enter multiple time intervals separated by commas `(,)`, for example: `7,15,22`. The condition will be evaluated at each specified interval, in this case every 7, 15, and 22 `days` or `weeks` or `months`, depending on the selected time unit.
    
     ![Custom intervals](__docs/images/local_cdr_custom-intervals.png)

2. **Recurring interval**:
   Allows you to enter a single interval so the condition is evaluated repeatedly at the specified cadence, for example: `7`, which means the evaluation runs every 7 `days` or `weeks` or `months`, depending on the selected time unit.

    ![Recurrent intervals](__docs/images/local_cdr_recurrent-intervals.png)

3. **Time unit**:
   Select the unit of time in which the condition will be evaluated. Available options: `days`, `weeks`, `months`.
   
    ![Time unit](__docs/images/local_cdr_time-unit.png)

4. **Base date**:
   Select the base date from which the condition will be evaluated. Available options:
   - `From enrolment date`: Intervals are counted from each user's enrolment date in the course.
   - `From course start date`: Intervals are counted from the course start date.
   - `From now`: Intervals are counted from the date the rule is created.

    ![Base date](__docs/images/local_cdr_base-date.png)
   
### Grade in activity

#### Description  
Use this condition to evaluate users' grades in a gradable activity. If the selected activity has multiple grade items, a dropdown will be shown with the available items.  

For example, in the `Forum` module, available grade items may include:  
- Whole forum grading  
- Grades  

![Forum whole forum item](__docs/images/local_cdr_forum-whole-forum-item.png)  
![Forum grades item](__docs/images/local_cdr_forum-grades-item.png)  

#### Condition configuration

1. **Search course activity modules**:
   From this search field, select the activity module where you want to check grades. 

   ![Grade in activity search](__docs/images/local_cdr_grade-in-activity-search.png)
   
   **Note**: Only activity modules that have at least the following setting in the `Activity completion` section will appear:

    ![Activity completion with require grade](__docs/images/local_cdr_activity-completion-with-require-grade.png)

2. **Comparison options**:  
   After selecting the activity, define the comparison conditions based on the available grade items. Two options are provided:  
   - `Must be â‰¥`: The condition is met if the user's grade is greater than or equal to the specified value.  
   - `Must be <`: The condition is met if the user's grade is less than the specified value.  
  
    ![Comparison options](__docs/images/local_cdr_comparison-options.png)


### Activity not completed

#### Description
Use this condition to evaluate whether a user has not completed a specific activity after a given period of time.

This condition runs recurrently via the scheduled task `local_coursedynamicrules\task\no_complete_activity_task`, which by default runs every minute.

The condition will only evaluate once when the time specified in the configuration has elapsed, as detailed in the section [Condition configuration](#condition-configuration-1).

After the condition is evaluated and the rule's actions are executed, the rule will be automatically deactivated.

#### Condition configuration

1. **Search course activity modules**:
   From this search field, select the activity module you want to verify has not been completed.

   ![No complete activity search](__docs/images/local_cdr_no-complete-activity-search.png)
   
   **Note**: Only activity modules that have at least the following setting in the `Activity completion` section will appear:

    ![Activity completion automatic](__docs/images/local_cdr_activity-completion-automatic.png)

2. **Expected completion date**:
    Define the date by which you expect users to have completed the activity.

    ![Expected completion date](__docs/images/local_cdr_expected-completion-date.png)


### No course access

#### Description
Use this condition to evaluate which users have not accessed a course within a specified period of time.

This condition runs recurrently via the scheduled task `local_coursedynamicrules\task\no_course_access_task`, which by default runs every minute. 

Once the condition is added to a rule, users matching the condition will start being evaluated and the rule's actions will be executed.

The condition will be re-evaluated each time the time period specified in the configuration has passed, as detailed in the following section [Condition configuration](#condition-configuration-2).

#### Condition configuration

1. **Period**:
   Define the time period in which you expect users to have accessed the course. Enter the numeric value in the first field and select the time unit in the second field.

    ![Time period](__docs/images/local_cdr_time-period.png)

### Activity completion with passing grade

#### Description
Use this condition to evaluate whether users have completed an activity with a passing grade.

#### Condition configuration

1. **Search course activity modules**:
   From this search field, select the activity module where you want to verify grades. 

    ![Pass grade search](__docs/images/local_cdr_pass-grade-search.png)
   
   **Note**: Only activity modules that have at least the following setting in the `Activity completion` section will appear:
