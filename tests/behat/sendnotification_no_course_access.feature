Feature: No course access with send notification action
  In order to notify course users reliably
  As an admin
  I need no course access rules to send primary and copy notifications correctly

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | student1 | Student1  | User1    | student1@example.com |
      | student2 | Student2  | User2    | student2@example.com |
      | teacher1 | Teacher1  | User1    | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
      | Course 2 | C2        | 0        |
      | Course 3 | C3        | 0        |
      | Course 4 | C4        | 0        |
      | Course 5 | C5        | 0        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C2     | student        |
      | teacher1 | C2     | editingteacher |

      | student2 | C5     | student        |
      | teacher1 | C5     | editingteacher |
    And the following local coursedynamicrules notifications are deleted:
      | username |
      | student1 |
      | student2 |
      | teacher1 |

  Scenario: Inactive primary recipients notify both primary and copy users

    And the following users last accessed courses:
      | username | course | secondsago |
      | student1 | C1     | 172800     |
      | teacher1 | C1     | 60         |
    When I run the scheduled task "\local_coursedynamicrules\task\no_course_access_task"
    Then "student1" should have 1 local coursedynamicrules notifications
    And "teacher1" should have 1 local coursedynamicrules notifications
    And the latest local coursedynamicrules notification for "student1" in "subject" should be exactly:
